# Application Layer



## Principles of Network Applications

When developing your new applications, you need to write software that will run on multiple end systems for communication with each other. Don't need and Don't allowed to write software that runs on network-core devices, such as routers or link-layer switches.

### Network Application Architectures

From application developer's perspective, the network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications. **Application architecture** is designed by the application developer and dictates how the application is structured over the various end systems.

- **Client-Server architecture**
  - An always-on host called *server*.
    - Uses a data center for large companies.
  - Services requests from many other hosts called *clients*.
- **Peer-to-Peer architecture**
  - Minimal reliance on dedicated servers in data centers.
  - Direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers.
  - **Self-scalability**, each peer generates workload as well as adds service capacity.

### Processes Communicating

This book focus on how processes running on different hosts communicate.
