# Elementary Data Structures



## Stacks and queues

- Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which elements removed from the set by delete operation is prespecified.
  - Stacks, LIFO
  - Queue, FIFO

## Linked lists

Linked list is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order.

## Implementing pointers and objects

- Multiple array representation of objects, a "struct" method.
- Single array representation of objects, a memory mapping of "struct" method.

## Representing rooted trees

- Linked list representation: {VT value, T* left, T* right}.
- Heap representation.
